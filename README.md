# bikeshed-intro

Create an introduction to using Bikeshed especially for new spec writers

The current GitHub Pages version of the document is at https://dlaliberte.github.io/bikeshed-intro/index.html
But that version does not contain the correct mermaid generated diagram, so until we fix that, just use the source page at
https://github.com/dlaliberte/bikeshed-intro/blob/updates/index.md
which GitHub correctly renders.
